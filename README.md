## Process:

takes group linked reservations and prints tab-separated list of name/room number combinations
this list can then be imported to any label template for printing

`--splitrooms` option splits name into separate labels for roommates

works only with PAR Springer-Miller Report: 5AR Groups/Others -> Linked Reservations -> Linked Reservations

## Usage:  

`reservations_label.pl <file name> [--splitrooms]`
